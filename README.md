### Description

MyNotes is an intuitive post-it simulator for navigators. Add and remove notes (literally) on a click. New functionalities coming soon!

## My process

### Initial ideas

At first, my intention was to build an utra-simple post-it app that anyone could use to write their notes. Then I realize that it could be a greater project since I keep updating its functionalities while I learn about new front-end concepts.

### Design

The color choicing was made having its simplicity in mind, in a way that not only generates good contrast but also matches with real world concepts.

#### Color Pallete

### Build with

- CSS Grid
- React
- Synchronous States
- Styled Components
- Local Storage

### Challenges

1. Learning CSS Grid from scratch:
- Understanding how to create responsive grids for mobile and desktop versions
- Setup the best grid configuration to different sizes of screens

2. Coping with IDs:
- Understanding how identifiers should work to delete elements from a page

3. Animations:
- Learning how CSS Animations and Keyframes work to create dynamic elements that response to the user interaction
